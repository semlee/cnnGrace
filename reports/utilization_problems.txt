Issues we are running into when trying to compute the baseline for intel avx2 machine:

We are running on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2660 v3 @ 2.60GHz machine.


Specs:
1. 2.60 Ghz - (Boosted 3.30 Ghz)
2. 10 physical cores
3. 2 sockets
4. HTT (Hyperthreading) enabled

Computed theoretical peak performance for the machine:
Avx2 = 256 bits with FMA support

(256/32) = 8 Elements can be operated on at once 
8 * 2 = 16 because FMA FLOPS/cycle

So:
16 * 10 * 2.60 = 416 GFLOPS [Theoretical Peak Performance per core, at low clock rate, without HTT]
16 * 10 * 3.30 = 528 GFLOPS [Theoretical Peak Performance per core, at low clock rate, without HTT]

Assuming for sustained avx2 we pick lower clock rate

------

Skylake SP (from paper) theoretical peak performance is around 4000 GFLOPS as per figure 4

Specs:
1. 2.30 Ghz for sustained avx512
2. 28 physical cores
3. 1 socket
4. HTT (?)
5. Has 2 AVX512  units per core

Computed theoretical machine peak:
Avx512 = 512 bits with FMA support
(512/32) = 16 Elements can be operated on at once
2 * 16 = 32 because FMA FLOPS/cycle
2 * 32 = 64 because 2 AVX512 units per core 

So:
64 * 28 * 2.30 = 4160 GFLOPS [Theoretical Peak Performance per core, at low clock rate, without HTT]

______

Intel APP Metrics sheets
1. Reports the machine peak for the E5 as 416 GFLOPS (This checks out with our computation)
2. Reports the machine peak for Skylake as 1033.6 GFLOPS (????)
_____

Issues:
1. Seungmin ran the experiment on Xeon and reports higher performance than theoretical machine peak.
2. Discrepancy between Skylake paper and Intel APP Metrics sheet (which makes our sanity check for E5 questionable)
_____

Possibliies:
1. HTT is enabled on the machine, and the theoretical peak is computed without HTT
	a) Seems like Skylake paper does not have HTT enabled, so it would not be a fair comparison

2. We are running on a machine with 2 sockets, and could possibly have had the program run on both sockets
	a) We have, in accordance with the shell scripts, tried to force the program to run on a single socket
	b) Seungmin has tried a few variations in the script, but we get the same result

3. There could be more than one Avx2 unit in the machine
	a) Unlikely, this is a server chip. Plus could not find anything online supporting this

4. Error in computing machine peak
_____
Steps to ensure an accurate hardware setup [TODO: Seungmin]
_____

Possible ideas to try:
1. Use taskset to force the program to run with physical cores only : taskset -c 0-20:2 ./run_resnet50.sh
